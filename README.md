# SuggestOppositeMovies

Full implementation of a content based filtering movie suggestor. 
The implementation uses similarity on keywords from content, actors, director and year. 
It is reversed such that it suggest the opposite movie of what is prompted. 
The implementatin uses Django to host the calculations and is done on the user end just to try how that would work.
